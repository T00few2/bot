# Self-Role System Guide

The DZR Discord bot includes a comprehensive self-role system that allows users to assign and remove roles themselves in a dedicated channel.

## Features

- **Interactive Role Selection**: Users can click buttons to add/remove roles
- **Admin Management**: Full control over which roles are available
- **Visual Interface**: Beautiful embed with role descriptions and emojis
- **Permission Checks**: Automatic validation of bot permissions and role hierarchy
- **Persistent Storage**: Configuration stored in Firebase

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup

First, set up the role system for your server:

```
/setup_roles channel:#role-selection
```

This command:
- Creates the role system configuration for your server
- Sets the designated channel where the role panel will appear
- Validates bot permissions in the channel

### 2. Add Roles to Selection

Add roles that users can self-assign:

```
/add_selfrole role:@RoleName description:"Role description" emoji:ðŸŽ®
```

Parameters:
- `role`: The role to add (required)
- `description`: Optional description shown in the panel
- `emoji`: Optional emoji for the button (Unicode or custom)

Example:
```
/add_selfrole role:@Gamer description:"For gaming enthusiasts" emoji:ðŸŽ®
/add_selfrole role:@Developer description:"Software developers" emoji:ðŸ’»
/add_selfrole role:@Artist description:"Creative artists" emoji:ðŸŽ¨
```

### 3. Create the Role Panel

Generate the interactive role selection panel:

```
/roles_panel
```

This command:
- Creates a beautiful embed with all available roles
- Adds interactive buttons for each role
- Updates the panel if it already exists
- Deletes the old panel when creating a new one

### 4. Remove Roles (Optional)

Remove roles from the selection list:

```
/remove_selfrole role:@RoleName
```

## User Experience

Once set up, users can:

1. **View Available Roles**: See all self-assignable roles in the embed
2. **Add Roles**: Click a button to get a role (if they don't have it)
3. **Remove Roles**: Click the same button to remove a role (if they have it)
4. **Get Feedback**: Receive confirmation messages for each action

## Bot Permissions Required

The bot needs these permissions:

### Server-wide:
- `Manage Roles` - To assign/remove roles
- `Send Messages` - To send the role panel
- `Embed Links` - To create rich embeds
- `Use Slash Commands` - For admin commands

### In the Role Channel:
- `View Channel` - To see the channel
- `Send Messages` - To post the role panel
- `Embed Links` - To create the embed

### Role Hierarchy:
- The bot's role must be **higher** than any roles it manages
- Managed roles (bot roles, integration roles) cannot be added to self-selection

## Admin Commands Reference

| Command | Description | Permissions |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/setup_roles` | Initialize the role system | Administrator |
| `/add_selfrole` | Add a role to self-selection | Administrator |
| `/remove_selfrole` | Remove a role from self-selection | Administrator |
| `/roles_panel` | Create/update the role panel | Administrator |

## Troubleshooting

### "I cannot manage this role"
- Ensure the bot's role is higher than the role you're trying to add
- Check that the role isn't managed by another bot/integration

### "I don't have permission to send messages"
- Verify the bot has Send Messages permission in the target channel
- Check that the bot can view the channel

### "Role system not setup"
- Run `/setup_roles` first to initialize the system
- Ensure you're running commands in the correct server

### Role buttons not working
- Check that the bot has Manage Roles permission
- Verify the bot's role hierarchy
- Ensure the role still exists and isn't managed

## Technical Details

### Data Storage
Role configurations are stored in Firebase Firestore under the `selfRoles` collection:

```json
{
  "guildId": {
    "channelId": "123456789",
    "roles": [
      {
        "roleId": "987654321",
        "roleName": "Gamer",
        "description": "For gaming enthusiasts",
        "emoji": "ðŸŽ®",
        "addedAt": "timestamp"
      }
    ],
    "panelMessageId": "111222333",
    "createdAt": "timestamp",
    "updatedAt": "timestamp"
  }
}
```

### Button Limitations
- Maximum 25 roles per panel (5 rows Ã— 5 buttons)
- For more roles, consider creating multiple panels or using categories

### Security Features
- Only administrators can manage the role system
- Automatic validation of role permissions
- Prevention of @everyone role assignment
- Managed role detection and blocking

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to consider:

1. **Web Dashboard**: Browser-based role management interface
2. **Role Categories**: Group roles into different categories
3. **Temporary Roles**: Roles that expire after a set time
4. **Role Requirements**: Prerequisite roles or conditions
5. **Usage Analytics**: Track role assignment statistics
6. **Multiple Panels**: Different role panels for different purposes
